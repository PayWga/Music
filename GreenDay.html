        <p class="GD_text">Starting in 1988, Green Day, originating from Belkeley, California, is one of the most influential rock bands of 21st century. Throughout their career they have recorded and published 12 full-lenght albums, 3 live albums over 45 music videos and over 40 singles.</p>
        <h3 id="GD_early" class="GD_text">Kerplunk</h3>
        <aside>
            <div class="GD_Kerplunk"></div>
        </aside>
        <p class="GD_text">Their second album, Kerplunk, was successful enough to interest Reprise Records, they offered Green Day a contract which the band took. Kerplunk, while not very popular, has some amazing tracks like 2000 Light Years Away, Welcome to Paradise and Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?. 2000 Light Years Away, the first song on the record, was written after the band's frontman, Billie Joe Armstrong, and his wife-to-be shared their first kiss. Then he went home and wrote the song. "Malakite" in the song's chorus is a green-colored stone, referring to Armstrong’s eye-color. <br>

            Welcome to Paradise, the third song in the album is mostly about a teenager that has left his mother's home and tried to find a place for himself in the world. In the first verse, the character only begins to adjust to life on his own "This sudden fear has left me trembling
            Cause now it seems that I am out there on my own." <br>
            The chorus shows the real conditions he lives in "I want to take you through a wasteland, I like to call my home". And in the second verse the character seems to have overcome the obstacles and adjusted to life on his own, but still lives in a "wasteland I like to call my home" because he is so used to it that "For some strange reason, it's now feeling like my home. And I'm never gonna go."
        </p>
        <h3 class="GD_text">Dookie</h3>
        <div class="GD_Dookie"></div>
        <p class="GD_text">Dookie, Green Day's first studio album, was a huge success, album's singles "Basket Case", "Longview" and "When I Come Around" topped the U.S. music charts for over 10 weeks after the record's release.
            Dookie sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. only.
            Following the release of the album, the band went on a tour, which contained some interesting events. On September 9, 1994, at the band's concert in Boston mayhem broke out during the band's performance, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. <br>
            The reason for Dookie's success is pretty simple, it appealed to the people of that time, the songs were mostly about teens and going through tough times, and pretty much everyone can relate to that. But band members were terrified of their success, they were, after all, punks, and so they weren't seeking fame with their music. In response to their success, Green Day started creating mayhem on their concerts. For example, in Woodstock in 1994 a mud fight broke out during the band's performance (one of the guards even mistook the band's bassist Mike Dirnt for a fan that climbed onstage and punched out some of his teeth), but people loved them, and, no matter what they did, still attended their live performances.</p>
        <h3 class="GD_text">Insomniac</h3>
        <div class="GD_Insomniac"></div>
        <p class="GD_text">Insomniac, band's second studio album, was released in 1995 and was basically a failure selling a total of 2 million copies around the globe. Even though the album wasn’t necessarily bad, it wasn’t something fans expected after a legendary album like Dookie. The record itself is even good but for various reasons, it wasn't rated well, maybe because while it was good it wasn't Green Day good.</p>
        <h3 class="GD_text">Nimrod</h3>
        <div class="GD_Nimrod"></div>
        <p class="GD_text">
            Nimrod, released in 1997, didn’t sell too good, stopping at just below 5 million copies sold worldwide, even though some people consider it the best Green Day record to date. <br>
            Nimrod is deviation since it’s first promotional single, Hitchin’ a Ride, which has a part played on a violin, and that alone is really interesting. The violin blends in almost perfectly, not being silenced by a guitar riff but at the same time not dictating the tempo of the song.
            Album’s second single, Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life), is usually referred to as "pop-punk campfire singalong ballad".

        </p>
        <h3 class="GD_text">Warning</h3>
        <div class="GD_Warning"></div>
        <p class="GD_text">is the sixth studio album by American rock band Green Day, released on October 3, 2000 by Reprise Records. Building upon its predecessor Nimrod (1997), it eschewed the band's trademark punk rock sound and incorporated acoustic elements and pop and folk styles. Lyrically, the album contains more optimistic and inspirational themes in comparison to the band's earlier releases. Warning was also Green Day's first album since Kerplunk (1991) that was not produced by Rob Cavallo, although he did have a hand in its production and was credited as executive producer.</p>
        <h3 id="GD_Idiot" class="GD_text">American Idiot</h3>
        <div class="GD_American_Idiot"></div>
        <p class="GD_text">American Idiot, released in 2004, is considered by the critics to be the best album created by Green Day. The album is a rock-opera, telling a story throughout the record. <br>
            The record starts with an anthem-like song, named after the album, it serves just as an introduction to the record and a declaration of thoughts and ideas. The second song introduces the main character of the story, "Son of rage and love", Jesus of Suburbia, the song shows Jesus' lifestyle and his contempt for everything around him, and that's why at the end of the song he leaves his home.</p>

        <p class="GD_text"> Holiday, the third song of the album shows Jesus after he left his hometown and starts exploring the outside world, but he finds only hate, misery, violence, and pain that forces him to walk “a lonely road” and “ This empty streets” on “the Boulevard of Broken Dreams”. The song became the most successful Green Day has ever written. </p>

        <p class="GD_text">
            The fifth song, called Are We the Waiting, is a kind of an interlude, show the main character become disappointed in the world and himself as Jesus of Suburbia, “The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie”.
            The sixth song shows the Jesus of Suburbia meeting St. Jimmy, “king of the forty thieves” that is there “to represent the needle in the vein of the establishment”. He calls himself a “suicide commando”, “the patron saint of the denial” with “an angel face and a taste for suicidal”. The song is mostly to introduce the character and to show who Jesus of Suburbia has met and what new friends he has made. <br>
            Give Me Novacaine is the seventh song of the album and it shows the Jesus of Suburbia blending in his new life, he doesn’t really like what he sees, so he goes to St. Jimmy, and he has just the right solution - Novacaine. In the song Jesus appears already seeking numbness from the outside world, so he asks, “Tell me that I won’t feel a thing. So give me novacaine.”.
            The next song, She’s a Rebel, introduces a new character into the story, “She’s a rebel, she’s a saint. She’s the salt of the earth and she’s dangerous.” “She’s the one that they call old “Whatsername”. After meeting her, Jesus of Suburbia falls in love with her, they get together, but it doesn’t last. <br>
            Extraordinary Girl shows the inner turmoil in both Jesus and Whatsername, “He, steals the image in her kiss, from her heart’s apocalypse, from the one called “Whatsername”, “Some days he feels like dying. She gets so sick of crying.”
            Letterbomb is a call to rise and revolt against the unfairness and injustice. Also, the end of the song is showing the split of Whatsername and Jesus of Suburbia, “She said I can’t take this town, I’m leaving you behind”. <br>
            Wake Me Up When September Ends shows the Jesus of Suburbia suffering from losing his love, Whatsername. So he is stuck in the past and dreams that, when September ends, he will be able to find happiness again. <br> </p>

        <p class="GD_text">
            Homecoming is a song about leaving your past behind and moving on to live a life, it’s a song about coming home and, most importantly, not being stuck in the past forever. At the beginning of the song, St. Jimmy kills himself, after declaring, “We’re f*cked up, but we’re not the same. And mom and dad are the ones you can blame.”. After that the focus of the plot switches back to Jesus of Suburbia, he is told to be “filling out paperwork now in the facility on East 12 Street. He’s in his own world and he’s daydreaming.” but at the end of the song, Jesus is shown to be coming back to his hometown. <br>
            The album's closing track, Whatsername, shows Jesus after he had returned back home. He is remembering Whatsername, the time they had together, he says "And in the darkest nights, if my memory serves me right. I'll never turn back time, forgetting you but not the time."

        <h3 class="GD_text">21st Century Breakdown</h3>
        <div class="GD_21st_Cent_Break"></div>
        <p class="GD_text">This album, that made out to be the best Green Day chart performance to date, was released in 2009. The record tells a story of a young pair facing against the troubles and unfairness of a modern world. The record itself is seperated into three parts: "Heroes and Cons", "Christians and Saints" and "Horseshoes and Handgrenades". One of the distinctive features of the album is the personalisation, the story is more centered on peeople and the society than American Idiot, the band's previos rock-opera.<br>
            21 Guns, the album's most successful song, is an anti-war anthem as a whole, and even though the chorus “one twenty-one guns” is a reference to the highest funeral honor - shooting 21 guns in the air - it is shown as one last act of war. “Lay down your arms, give up the fight” is a calling to stop war and violence. The song’s plot mostly focuses on how war destroys lives, but also on the overall horrors of wars. “Do you know what’s worth fighting for. When it’s not worth dying for.” is basically what a young soldier experiences when he first gets to the frontier. That feeling of being lost is somewhat spread over all Green Day albums and songs. The next lines “Does it take your breath away? And you feel yourself suffocating.” are probably referring to fear so strong it’s suffocating, which can be experienced by people at war. Note also that almost half of the lines in the first verse are questions, but all of them are asked rhetorically, almost like statements. The second verse of the song refers to how war breaks people's lives, how it is never the same once you take another human's life, "When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul", "And the hangover doesn't pass".</p>

        <h3 id="GD_Recent" class="GD_text">Uno . . . Dos . . . Tré!</h3>
        <div class="GD_Uno_Dos_Tre"></div>
        <p class="GD_text">A huge three-part album with each part dedicated to one of the band members respectively, the chapters were released separately with Uno! first on September 21, Dos! on November 9 and Tre! on December 7, 2012. The record was met with generally positive reviews from critics. <br>
            Uno!Dos!Tre! is mostly about Green Day coming back to the basics and adapting them to a new time, but the album still contained some surprises. Kill the DJ, a single from Uno! that was released before the album, sounds uncharacteristically poppy and clubby, even though the song is overall really good with some great lyrics and rhythm. <br>
            In comparison, Uno! is the most fast-paced one of the three reminds of some older Green Day songs with tracks like Stay the Night, Angel Blue, Oh Love and Carpe Diem serving as the album's anthem, while Dos! has a couple of ballads(acoustic See You Tonight and Amy with Stray Heart just being ballad-like) and the finishing Tre! is something in between having ballads like Drama Queen and Green Day classic-like 99 Revolutions and A Little Boy Named Train.</p>
        <h3 class="GD_text">Revolution Radio</h3>
        <div class="GD_Revolution_Radio"></div>
        <p class="GD_text">After a 4 year break Green Day returned with a new album and it was a mix of their old style and new experiments. Songs like Forever Now, Somewhere Now, Ordinary World introduce a new Green Day sound, while songs like Too Dumb to Die and Youngblood remind of their older stuff.</p>
