                    <p class="card-text bmth_text">Is an English metal band formed in Yorkshire, England in 2004 that evolved from death metal to alt-metal with elements of pop.</p>

        <div class="bmth_art d-flex flex-row mx-auto">
            <div class="bmth_Count mr-4"></div>
            <p class="bmth_art_text">Formed in 2004, the band released their debut album, Count Your Blessings, in 2004. It was a proper metal record with the first song being 4 minutes long with aggressive riffs and a lot of metal screaming.
                Their second album, Suicide Season, was a little less heavy but still considered metal.

            <p class="bmth_art_text">There is a Hell, Believe Me, I’ve Seen It. There is A Heaven, Let’s Keep It a Secret is the band’s third album. Influenced by nightmares and fears it contains lyrics about depression and dejection with a decent amount of guitar and metal screams.</p>
            <div class="bmth_There"></div>

        <h3 id="Transition" class="bmth_art">The Transition</h3>
        <h4 class="bmth_art">Sempiternal</h4>
        <div class="bmth_art d-flex flex-row mx-auto">
            <div class="bmth_Sempiternal"></div>
            <p class="bmth_art">Sempiternal, their fourth album and a first massive breakthrough, was marked as hard rock but still contained some songs that didn’t fit the genre. Songs like Deathbeds And the Snakes Start To Sing are slow, melodic and not nearly as heavy as other songs like Sleepwalking, The House of Wolves and Crooked Young. </p>
        </div>
        <p class="bmth_art">
            The record, while being considered hard rock, has a lot more electronic elements than any of their previous albums. Starting with this record, Bring Me the Horizon started including more and more electronic sounds and more synth parts which led to creation of their most popular album to date, That's the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p class="bmth_art">In general, Sempiternal is a story of struggle both internal and external, engaging in a fight between you and all of the outside world, while also waging wars inside your mind. Songs like Sleepwalking, And the Snakes Start to Sing and Seen It All Before are about the internal struggles, while Go To Hell, For Heavens Sake, Antivist, Crooked Young and some others are about the external ones.</p>
        <h4 class="bmth_art">That's the Spirit</h4>
        <div class="bmth_art d-flex flex-row mx-auto">
            <div class="bmth_That"></div>
            <p class="bmth_art">That's the Spirit, was the band's fifth album and their biggest commercial success to date. The record debuted at №1 in Australia and Canada, №2 in the UK Album Chart, and the US Billboard 200. The album also showed band's deviation from their original hardcore metal sound.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="bmth_art">Even though the record contained heavy elements in songs like Doomed, Happy Song and What You Need, it was obvious that the band took a new direction with their sound. It was no longer heavy metal, it was mostly metalcore with some elements of pop. Even the heaviest songs of the album have a lot of electronic elements, unlike their previous albums. And songs like Follow You, Run and Oh No are bordering pop with their sound.</p>
        <h3 id="Latest" class="bmth_art">Latest Works</h3>
        <h4 class="bmth_art">Amo</h4>
        <div class="bmth_art d-flex flex-row mx-auto">
            <p class="bmth_art_text">The bands sixth and latest album to date was preceded by five singles with "Mantra" being the leading one, it was released on 21st of August 2018, full five months before the album itself was released, on 25 January 2019.</p>
            <div class="bmth_Amo"></div>
        </div>
        <p class="bmth_art">The record shows the band exploring a more pop sound and using a lot more electrical sounds, for example in the leading single, Mantra, the word "Mantra" is said by a robotic TTS (text-to-speech) voice. And overall the record sounds way more like pop than metal.</p>
